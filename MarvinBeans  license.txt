 * HELM Notation Toolkit and Editor require MarvinBeans version 5.0 or higher from ChemAxon. 
 * A copy of the required library (MarvinBeans-5.0.jar) is included for your convenience. 
 * ChemAxon has graciously agreed to provide a royalty-free license for the utilization of MarvinBeans directly 
 * through the HELM notation toolkit and editor (specifically for operations pertaining to the chemical representation 
 * of HELM monomers and macromolecules.) Please contact Cassell Essell (cessell@chemaxon.com) to obtain this license. 
 * Utilization of the MarvinBeans library outside of the aforementioned scope and beyond a trial basis requires the 
 * procurement of a regular MarvinBeans license.
